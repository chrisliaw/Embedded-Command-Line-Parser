Cmdline Parser
______________

I intended to design the command line parser to be embedded into my application. 
However, since more and more project of mine include this as library, i decided to separate it out as gem so that
i can share it with all my project instead. After all, if i update in one place, all my project received the update.

Please sent me comment of your usage of the library! I would love to hear that!
